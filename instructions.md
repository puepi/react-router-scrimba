 * Challenge: Create the Vans list page, Route, and Link
 * 
 * 1. Create a Vans component in the "pages" directory. For now,
 *    just render <h1>Vans page goes here 🚐</h1>
 * 2. Create a Route for the Vans page on the /vans route
 * 3. Add a Link in the nav bar to the Vans route

/**
 * Challenge: Fetch and map over the data to display it on
 * the vans page. For an extra challenge, spend time styling
 * it to look like the Figma design.
 * 
 * Hints:
 * 1. Use `fetch(/api/vans)` to kick off the request to get the
 *    data from our fake Mirage JS server
 * 2. What React hook would you use to fetch data as soon as the
 *    Vans page loads, and only fetch it the one time?
 * 3. You may get an error saying "console.groupCollapsed is not
 *    a function". You can ignore it for now.
